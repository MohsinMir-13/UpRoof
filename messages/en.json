We needed to remove the chimney, seal the chimney hole in the roof and wall, as well as remove the fasteners where the chimney was attached to the outer wall, and seal the holes there as well. They also inspected the roof and sealed the cracks where water was leaking through. They then removed all the materials and left a completely clean, beautiful place, and they also neatly put the removed chimney pipe back where it needed to be. Fantastic attitude towards us as a customer, very pleasant cooperation. We will definitely turn to them again when the need arises!"
